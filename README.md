This repo is a very, very brief sample of some code and analysis corresponding to the `idLogit` method described in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NAkj0c1H5kCUv64mC1v8n3oH56OmHViUlNSkSSnIe-k/edit), as applied to Carrol & Verhall's "Authentic Distilleries" data. 

I recommend simply reviewing the `bootstrap.ipynb` file for an overview. However this file simply analyzes data and results, and does not contain any of the analysis itself. If you want to see how the analysis was done, review `idLogit.py` and `runner.sh`. 

Running this code requires the underlying data, which I am not authorized to provide. Reach out to me at [morrowwr@gmail.com](mailto:morrowwr@gmail.com) if you are interested.
